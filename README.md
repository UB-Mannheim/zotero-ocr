This Zotero plugin adds the functionality to perform an OCR for the PDFs
selected in Zotero. It can add a new PDF including the recognized text,
a note with the recognized text only, and HTML (HOCR) file(s).
Tesseract OCR is used for the text recognition itself.


## Prerequisites

- Tesseract OCR is installed
  - for Windows see https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
  - for Linux, Mac see https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html
- `pdftoppm` from poppler library is downloaded and installed
  - some hints for the installation: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/zotero-ocr/wiki/Install-pdftoppm


## Installation

To install the extension:

* Download the XPI file of the [latest release](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/zotero-ocr/releases).
* In Zotero, go to Tools → Add-ons and drag the .xpi onto the Add-ons window.
* Possibly, adjust the path to Tesseract in the add-on options.


## Configuration

The configuration can be accessed under Tools → Zotero OCR Preferences.

By default the fields for the paths to the OCR engine and pdftoppm are empty,
which means, that the usual locations are looked at. If that does not work,
then you should locate the tools on your local mashine and enter the full
paths including the name of the tools itself.

The default language/script to use with Tesseract, can only be one of the installed
models. If you leave that field empty, then the English model (eng) will be used, which is
always installed with Tesseract.

Moreover, these options are saved as Zotero preferences variables, which
are also available through the
[Config Editor](https://www.zotero.org/support/preferences/advanced).


## Build and release

Run `build.sh` script, which creates a new `.xpi` file.

For a new release, run the script `release.sh`, push the code changes, publish a [new release on GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/zotero-ocr/releases/new) and attach the `.xpi` file there.


## Development

After any code changes one can build a new extension file by `./build.sh <version>`.
Then in Zotero go to `Tools`, `Add-ons`, `Install Add-on From File...`
and choose there the newly created `.xpi`-file. Zotero will restart with the
newly built add-on version.

If any error occurs then you will see more details in the `Help`, `Report Error...`
dialog. For some debugging messages you can activate in Zotero the debugging
in the `Help`, `Debug Output Logging`.
