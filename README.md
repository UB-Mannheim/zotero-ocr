# Zotero OCR

This Zotero plugin adds the functionality to perform an OCR for the PDFs
selected in Zotero. It can add a new PDF including the recognized text,
a text itself in a note, and an HOCR file.
Tesseract OCR is used for the text recognition itself.


## Prerequisites

- Tesseract OCR is installed
  - for Windows see https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
  - for Linux, Mac see https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki
- `pdftoppm` from poppler library is downloaded and installed


## Installation

To install the extension:

* Download the XPI file of the [latest release](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/zotero-ocr/releases).
* In Zotero, go to Tools â†’ Add-ons and drag the .xpi onto the Add-ons window.
* Possibly, adjust the path to Tesseract in the add-on options.


## Configuration

The configuration is in the `Tools` under `Zotero OCR Preferences`:

![Zotero OCR Preferences](./screenshots/Zotero-OCR-Preferences.png)

Moreover, these options are saved as Zotero preferences variables, which
are also available through the
[Config Editor](https://www.zotero.org/support/preferences/advanced).


## Build and release

Run `build.sh` script, which creates a new `.xpi` file.

For a new release, run the script `release.sh`, push the code changes, publish a [new release on GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/zotero-ocr/releases/new) and attach the `.xpi` file there.


## Development

After any code changes one can build a new extension file by `./build.sh <version>`.
Then in Zotero go to `Tools`, `Add-ons`, `Install Add-on From File...`
and choose there the newly created `.xpi`-file. Zotero will restart with the
newly built add-on version.

If any error occurs then you will see more details in the `Help`, `Report Error...`
